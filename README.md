# CollabKG: A Learnable Human-Machine-Cooperative Information Extraction Toolkit for (Event) Knowledge Graph Construction
- CollabKG is an open-source IE annotation toolkit that **unifies NER, RE, and EE tasks**, integrates **KG and EKG**, and supports both English and Chinese languages. 
- CollabKG **combines automatic and manual labeling** to build a learnable human-machine cooperative system. In particular, humans benefit from machines and meanwhile, manual labeling provides a reference for machines to update during annotation. 
- Additionally, CollabKG is designed with many other **appealing features** (customization, training-free, propagation, etc) that enhance productivity, power, and user-friendliness. We holistically compare our toolkit with other existing tools on these features.
- CollabKG **Extensive human studies** suggest that CollabKG can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of manual annotation, as well as reduce variance.

## Getting started

CollabKG can be built using Docker. Before doing so please add a secure token to the `TOKEN_SECRET` field in `/server/.env` for user password hashing and salting. 
Moreover, you should put your `openai key` in `server_cluster/tokens.txt` After this, in the repository root directory, execute:

```
$ make run
```

or alternatively:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
